# Code Ready Workspaces Operator Installer and Stack/Devfile/Lang Server Sidecar Dependencies Builder

This repo was for CodeReady Workspaces 1.x and 2, in support of non-operator based deployment (OCP 3.11). As of 2.0, deployment to OCP 3.11 is hanlded by crwctl:

https://github.com/redhat-developer/codeready-workspaces-chectl/releases

Therefore, this repo now only contains builds for collecting 3rd party dependencies needed by stack/devfile/lang server sidecar images.

## What's Inside

This repository contains:

* `node10`, `python`, `golang`, `php` :: language servers and their dependencies packaged as tar.gzs, retrieved via Docker-based builds; these are then included in the stacks' container builds

* `kamel` :: kamel build from source

* `build.sh` :: build all of the above artifacts locally

* `Jenkinsfile` :: script that builds all of the above artifacts in Jenkins

## What's NOT Inside, or Where did ___ go?

This repository no longer contains:
* `stacks/dependencies` :: moved to root of this repo

* `operator-installer` :: moved to https://github.com/redhat-developer/codeready-workspaces-chectl/releases

* `deploy.sh` :: moved to https://github.com/redhat-developer/codeready-workspaces-chectl/releases

* `custom-resource.yaml` :: moved to https://github.com/redhat-developer/codeready-workspaces-chectl/tree/master/docs

* `stacks/dependencies/dotnet` :: only required for dotnet 2.1; CRW 2.1 includes dotnet 3.1

* `stacks/dependencies/bayesian` :: implemented as VScode extension in CRW 2.x

* `stacks/dependencies/node8` :: only supported on RHEL 7; not included in CRW 2.x

### Why codeready-workspaces-deprecated?

Originally the name was chosen based on some now-incorrect assumptions about future deployment process and how Che 7 would be built.

Note that the process for collecting 3rd party deps may also change in future (eg., we might build more from source, or use a different process to collect them). So it's still deprecated in that sense. 

Some examples of alternative ways to source 3rd party dependencies to include in CRW builds are below.
